# 🧠 AI-Enabled Testing Metrics Dashboard – "TestGenie" Powered

🧾 **Overview**  
The **AI-Enabled Testing Metrics Dashboard** is a centralized analytics solution designed to transform how QA teams, project managers, and stakeholders visualize and interact with testing data. Built using **Power BI**, **SQL**, and **Excel**, this interactive dashboard provides **end-to-end traceability**, **defect analytics**, and **test execution summaries**. 

What sets this dashboard apart? An embedded **AI assistant called “TestGenie”**—a natural language Q&A tool that allows users to query testing metrics in plain English.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Bridge the gap between scattered test data and real-time decision-making.
- Provide **visibility across testing lifecycles**: Epics → Features → Stories → Tasks → Defects.
- Integrate an **AI chatbot** (TestGenie) to reduce manual effort in retrieving insights.
- Empower QA leads and stakeholders to track **defect leakage**, **automation coverage**, and **test effectiveness**.
- Facilitate **fast, actionable decisions** in reviews, retrospectives, and leadership meetings.

## 🧠 My Contribution – *Hari Krishna Balamurali*

I was **solely responsible** for the **Test Summary Dashboard** and the development of the **AI chatbot – TestGenie**, which includes:

- Designing KPIs like Test Cycle Time, Test Effectiveness, Feature Blockage, and Automation Coverage.
- Building AI-powered Q&A experience using **Power BI’s natural language capabilities**.
- Integrating backend relationships across 5 layers of testing artifacts for end-to-end data traceability.
- Optimizing dashboard interactivity and layout for executive reviews.

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- **Microsoft Excel** – Mock data preparation
- **SQL** – Data modeling & relationships
- **Power BI** – Dashboard development, DAX measures, AI Q&A
- **Natural Language Processing** – AI Assistant via Power BI Q&A engine

## 🧩 Data Model

Structured on **five key entities**:

**Epic → Feature → User Story → Task → Defect**

## 📊 Dashboard Modules

### 📌 1. Requirements Traceability Matrix
- Hierarchical trace: Program → Epic → Story → Task → Defect
- Color-coded status indicators
- Instantly flags missing ownership or delays

### 🐞 2. Defect Analytics
- Track defect health by Severity, Age, Status
- Key KPIs: Defect Leakage, Resolution Rate, Recurrence Rate, MTTD

### 📦 3. Test Summary Dashboard
- Real-time entity counts and test health
- KPIs: Test Cycle Time, Test Effectiveness, Feature Blockage, Automation Coverage

## 🤖 AI Assistant – TestGenie

> 💬 Ask:
> - “Pending defects in Epic EP-004?”
> - “Which features are blocked?”
